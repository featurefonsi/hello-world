Hi Folks!

I'm learning to code and so far i like clang and python. I also interested in Cybersec and Networking. 
I'd love working with CLI more than using GUI. 
My journey has already started and i can't wait, to make further progress and learn more, til i can proudly say, 
i can code and develope software i'll find useful. 

Best regards
